AMPTR is a shield for Arduino Mini Pro development board. It allows to power the Arduino from a 7-15 V DC source and includes power outputs that allow to switch loads up to 500 mA per channel (7 PWM channels total). It is also partially compatible with the original Arduino Mini development kit (which has a different pin configuration).
